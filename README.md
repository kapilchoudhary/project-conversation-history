# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you need to cover:

* Ruby Version: `3.0.0`

* Rails Version: `6.0.6.1`

* Run Bundle
  `bundle install`

* Configure the postgres username and password in `database.yml`.

  Then, we need to run in terminal - 
  `rails db:create` and `rails db:migrate`

  After this need to exit from the terminal run: `exit`
  Run rails server
